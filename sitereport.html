                    This report will begin with my learnings throughout this module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the module is called Web Development, I immediately assume we will go learn about frontend side of creating websites, UI and so forth using HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My guesses were confirmed as we are introduced to different types of website pages in the beginning classes along with our goal. To create a website page ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were then introduced to fundamental HTML and commonly used syntaxes and created a very basic and barebones web page but still a web page nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then were introduced to CSS and the basics of UI for a webpage through coding. We were taught various forms of CSS like inline, external class/id and external line/block specific with a clear overall better method of applying CSS with external class/id as it is the most efficient and clean method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we learned about various CSS syntaxes and properties like Colors, Text Styles, Display-Flex, inserting images, videos, etc. It took a bit of time for us to get used to all the syntaxes but we eventually understood them and began using them extensively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After we learned so much about HTML and CSS, our module leader inquired us about our assignment 1. The assignment was to create a website with multiple pages, an index page which is like a portfolio, a project page meant to be a placeholder page for the second assignment later for this module, a site report page to document our learnings throughout the module including working on the current assignment, a contact page that has our basic contact information with a form to send a message to the website and last but not least, a video demo page showcasing the website that we've made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me personally a week to complete the assignment and it was honestly interesting to see code that I write with my own ideas actually turn into a website that looks the way I envisioned it with my aesthetics and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learned quite a lot throughout this module and am eager to learn more, especially Javascript for the second assignment.
